\TheVariable[EXECUTION_MODE]{EXECUTION\_MODE}%
\Variable{EXECUTION\_MODE}

Stores or sets the execution mode for the script. The execution mode specifies
how commands without arguments are executed. In a bash script commands
do not need any parenthesis to be executed; but sometimes it is usefull
to assign a command to a variable to execute the command at a later time.

If the modus is set to execute the commands without the need for parenthesis
then the \Command*{create} command needs to be used to assign a command to
a variable for later execution. Defaults to the \code{IMPLICIT} mode.
The variable can be changed in the script but it will only effect the next
commands.

\begin{asparadesc}
%
\item[\code{IMPLICIT}]  \hfill \\
commands without arguments are executed when they are encountered in the script;
no parenthesis needed.
%
\item[\code{EXPLICIT}]  \hfill \\
commands without arguments are executed only if parenthesis are given.
%
\end{asparadesc}
