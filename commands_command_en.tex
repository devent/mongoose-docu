The \Type{Command} type defines the interface for all external and
build-in commands. All commands inherit the properties and operators
from the \Type{Command} type.
The function of the properties and operators is described
in the next sections.

\begin{asparadesc}
%
\item[\code{theName}] \hfill \\
the name of the command. The name is unique to build-in commands; for external
commands the name is the basename\cite{basename13} of the command.
The property can only be read.
%
\item[\code{theEnvironment}] \hfill \\
the current environment of the command. The environment contains the
build-in variables of the script and is the context in which a command is executed.
The property can only be read.
%
\item[\code{pipeBufferSize}] \hfill \\
the size of the buffer for the pipe between two commands. The size will affect
the left hand size command of the \Operator*{pipe} operator.
Default is set to
1024 bytes.
