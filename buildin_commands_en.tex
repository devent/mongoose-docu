\section{Build-In Commands}

As external commands all build-in commands returning a value after execution.
The return value is for the most commands \code{true} indicating the success of the
execution. The return value can be assigned a variable or can used in \code{if},
\code{for}, \code{while} or \code{switch} statements.

Build-in commands will throw an recoverable exception from type
\code{java.lang.Exception} for anticipated errors, like file now found, directory
not found, I/O errors and so on. This exceptions can be catched by a
\code{try-catch} statement.
