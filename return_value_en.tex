\subsection{Return Value}

External and build-in commands returning a return value from type
\code{ReturnValue}. The most basic return value contains only a human readable
representation of the status of the command.

Most commands return \code{ReturnCode} as the return value. It contains a number
value as the return code from the command. As a convention the
code \code{0} is equavalent to the value \code{true} and any value not \code{0}
is equavalent to \code{false} and is representing an error code.
