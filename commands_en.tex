\section{Commands}

Commands are identifier that are not class, interface, methods names or Java
or Groovy key-words or build-in variables. There are two kinds of commands:
external commands and build-in commands.

External commands are executes as a separated process, either in the foreground
or in the background. External commands are only available if found in the
search path or in the current working directory.
Build-in commands are always available and are executed in the current process.
Build-ins are like functions or methods that can be executed.
