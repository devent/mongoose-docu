\section{Vision Statement}

The software is to create Bash scripts in the Groovy language.

The current Bash scripts are very powerful but also limited in some ways.
The Bash scripts are good at calling external applications and commands and
re-direct input and output streams.

Most notably there are no explicit parameter, no classes and no exceptions
in Bash scripts. Programming is done procedural and parameters are passed in
special variables \code{\$1}\dots\code{\$9}. Failures are communicated with
return codes.

A script in Groovy can enhance the Bash script with object oriented programming,
exceptions, logging but can stay as easy to use. Groovy is a dynamic programming
language and as such we can create a domain specific language (DSL) designed for
Bash like scripts.
