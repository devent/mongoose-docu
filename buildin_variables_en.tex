\section{Build-In Variables}

Build-in variables storing various parameter of the script.
Those variables can be accessed anywhere in the script. 

In addition to the described variables the system environment can
be accessed inside the script. The system environment is a 
system-dependent mapping of variable names to values that is passed from
the parent process to the child process. The variables of the system environment
are normally in upper case with an underscore as word separator\footnote{for example SSH\_AGENT\_PID, HOSTNAME, M2\_HOME, PATH}.
