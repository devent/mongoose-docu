\TheVariable{LOCALE}%
\Variable{LOCALE}

The current locale of the script; the locale is of 
type \Type{Locale}\cite{locale13}. The script resources 
are loaded based on the locale. 

The locale can be changed by either setting the variable to
a different locale or by calling 
\code{Locale\#setDefault(Locale.Category, Locale)} or
\code{Locale\#setDefault(Locale)}.

While the \Variable{LOCALE} variable is initially set to the value of the environment
\code{LANG}, any change to the \Variable{LOCALE}\cite{posixenviron13} variable does not affect the
environment of child processes of the script. To do that, the environment of
the child process must be set, see \Command*{run} command.
