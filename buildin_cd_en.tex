\label{par:cd}
\parparameter{\parcommand{cd} [\partype{dir}]}

Change the current working directory to the specified directory \partype{dir}.
\partype{dir} defaults to the user home directory, see \refpar{par:user_home}.

At the start the current working directory is the directory where the script was started.
The command will change that directory and all relative paths are interpreted
as to start from the new current directory.

Always returns \code{true}. If the directory could not be changed an
exception will be thrown to indicate the cause.

Throws \code{DirectoryNotFound} (\refpar{par:directory_not_found}) if the directory does not exists or is not
readable. A directory can be not readable if the read flag or the directory flag
is not set, see \code{chmod}.

\subparagraph{Example:}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=Groovybash, label={lst:example_cd}]
cd
cd HOME
cd "foo/bar"
\end{lstlisting}
