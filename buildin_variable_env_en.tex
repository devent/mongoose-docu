\TheVariable{ENV}%
\Variable{ENV}

An map of the current environment variables. The map will contain
at script start the enherited environment variables from the parent process.
The environment variables can also be obtained by \code{System\#getenv()}\cite{getenv13}.
The environment variables are not type safe; they are just strings.
The variables can also be changed by the \Command*{export} build-in command.

Subsequent commands will use a copy of the environment variables. 
Already running or finished commands will not see the changes
made to \Variable{ENV}.
