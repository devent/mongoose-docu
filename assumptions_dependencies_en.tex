\begin{multicols}{2}[\section{Assumptions and Dependencies}]

The software should be implemented on the Java platform. The main dependency
of the software is memory, because we need to calculate the nodes of the fractal
with a satisfying amoung of layers.

It should be possible to distribute the calculation of the fractal on multiple
computers, because the calculation is very time intensive.

\subsection{Possible Dependencies}

\subsubsection{Hazelcast}

Hazelcast\footnote{\url{http://www.hazelcast.com/}}
is a distributed in memory data grid available under the Apache Licence.
It have a Elastic Memory implementation with is off-heap memory storage for big
data. The Elastic Memory is only available in Hazelcast Enterprise Edition with
have a commercially licensed edition of Hazelcast.

\subsubsection{Ehcache and BigMemory}

Ehcache\footnote{\url{http://terracotta.org/documentation/overview}}
supports distributed caching and is available under the Apache 2.0 licence.
It can be used with BigMemory, with is off-heap memory storage for big
data. BigMemory is only available in Enterprise Ehcache.

\subsubsection{Java Caching System}

JCS\footnote{\url{http://commons.apache.org/jcs/}}
is a distributed caching system and is available under the Apache licence.
It has an disk cache to swap entries to disk.
